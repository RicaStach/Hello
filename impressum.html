                Disclaimer:<br/>
                Liability for content<br/>
                The content of our website was created with the greatest of care. However, we cannot guarantee that this
                content is correct, complete or up to date. Pursuant to §7 par. 1 of TMG (German Telemedia Act), we, as
                service provider, are responsible under the general laws for our own content on this website. However,
                according to §§ 8 to 10 of TMG, we, as service provider, are not obligated to monitor any third-party
                information transmitted or stored on our website or to investigate circumstances indicating an illegal
                activity. This does not affect the obligations under the general laws to remove or block the use of
                information. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of an
                actual infringement of law. Once we become aware of such legal violations, we shall remove the
                respective contents immediately.<br/>
                <br/>
                Liability for links<br/>
                Our service includes links to external websites but we have no influence over their content. Therefore,
                we cannot accept responsibility for these third-party contents. In each case, it is the respective
                provider or operator of the linked websites who is responsible for their contents. The linked websites
                were checked for any legal irregularities at the time the link was established and no illegal contents
                were recognisable at that point in time. However, continuous monitoring of the contents of the linked
                pages cannot be reasonably expected unless there are concrete reasons for suspecting legal violations.
                Once we are aware of illegal content, we shall remove the respective links immediately.<br/>
                <br/>
                Copyright<br/>
                The contents and works created by the page operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                The duplication, editing, dissemination and all kinds of utilisation beyond the constraints of copyright
                law require written approval by the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages
                are only for private and not for commercial use. Insofar as the contents on this website were not
                created by the operator, third-party copyrights are respected. In particular, third-party contents will
                be marked as such. Should you nevertheless notice a copyright infringement, please inform us
                accordingly. Once we become aware of violations of rights, we shall remove the respective contents
                immediately.<br/>
                <br/>
                Data protection<br/>
                It is generally possible to use our website without providing personal data. Insofar as we collect
                personal data via this website (for example, name, address or e-mail addresses), this is, as far as
                possible, always on a voluntary basis. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties without
                your express permission. We wish to remind you that there are inherent security risks in transmitting
                data (for example, email communication) via the Internet. It is not possible to ensure that data is
                completely protected against unauthorised access by third parties. Third parties are expressly
                prohibited from using contact details published herein, as required under the “Impressum” (legal notice)
                requirement of German law, for the purpose of sending advertising or informational material which has
                not been specifically requested. Where spam e-mails or other unsolicited advertising information is
                sent, the operators of the relevant websites specifically reserve the right to take legal action.<br/>

                as this is legally required or if these third parties use the supplied data on behalf of Google. Under
                no circumstances will Google use your IP address in connection with other data supplied by Google
                Inc.<br/>
